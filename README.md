# My first Backend
> initial setup

At this point you should be able to run the project with an available endpoint.

See [CHANGELOG](./CHANGELOG.md)

If you wish to test this app, clone it into your local workspace and move to it:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/APIS-UAM-PU/my-first-backend.git
cd my-first-backend
```

Then install dependencies

```sh
npm install
```

And finally run
```sh
npm run dev
```

Now if you request in the browser or any http-request tool `http://localhost:3000/`, you should get something like

```json
{
    "message": "Hello World!"
}
```
